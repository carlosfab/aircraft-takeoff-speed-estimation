## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project aims to estimate the takeoff speed of aircraft using computer vision techniques. By analyzing video footage of aircraft takeoffs, the system detects and tracks the aircraft, calculates their speed, and provides real-time speed estimations in knots. The project utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model and the Supervision library for video analysis and annotation.

The system can be useful for aviation enthusiasts, researchers, or professionals interested in monitoring and analyzing aircraft performance during takeoffs. It provides a non-intrusive way to estimate takeoff speeds and can potentially assist in identifying any unusual or abnormal takeoff patterns.
