    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the foundational step in constructing an application designed to estimate the takeoff speed of aircraft. Utilizing actual footage from Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro, this example demonstrates the practical application of video processing in extracting meaningful data from real-world scenarios. The video required for this example will be obtained using the `sigmoidalvision` library.\n",
